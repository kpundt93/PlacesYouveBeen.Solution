Places You've Been
Make a website where you can enter places you've been to create an online travel diary.

A Place should be an object. Begin by giving it the property cityName.

After testing all back-end logic and developing an MVC front-end for this application, expand your Place model to include relevant properties like picture(s), how long you stayed, whom you travelled with, a journal entry, and so on. Integrate these into your front-end MVC application.

At the very least, the front end MVC web application should support RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes.
